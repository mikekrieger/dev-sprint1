*** Cut and paste the for loop here ***

1) A route is a decorator that is used to register a view function for a given URL rule. You specify a routing within the document and then you define and list what the route returns.

2) index

3) hello

4) 
@app.route("/world")
def hellow():
    return "Hello, World"


5) No, because the app needs a main function.
